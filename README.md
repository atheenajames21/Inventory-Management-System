# Inventory-Management-System

The INventory Management System was a Python project developed with Tkinter and MySQL by my friends(Aleena and Atheena) and myself as a college project. THis proct has various features like adding and updating CAtegories, subcategories, brands and products. One can also change the admin details, etc. Here we have developed a sstem through which the user is notified whenever a product falls below a threshold level.
